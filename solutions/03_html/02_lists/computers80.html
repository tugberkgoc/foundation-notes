        <h1>1980s' Home Computers</h1>

        <p>
            In early 1980s, home computers became mainstream. For the first time, computers could be purchased
            by an average family household.
        </p>

        <h2>Clever uses</h2>
        <p>
            The main usage for a home computer was, of course, games. As cool games may not be a valid reason for
            purchasing an expensive gadget, a wide variety of potential uses were invented to satisfy those family
            members who might otherwise be sceptical.
        </p>

        <p>Some reasons often mentioned were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>learning to write computer programs</li>
            <li>managing family finances</li>
            <li>keeping track of freezer contents</li>
            <li>doing the family's taxes</li>
            <li>editing images</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Uses of modern computers:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>communication</li>
            <li>research</li>
            <li>automation</li>
            <li>content creation</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Legendary computers</h2>
        <p>The best known computer of the eighties was Commodore 64, but there are other computers that gained popularity.</p>

        <h2>Key concepts</h2>
        <p>
            The hardware charateristics of a home computer could be defined by its graphics and sound capabilities,
            CPU, and amount of memory.

        <h3>Components of 1980s' computers:</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Monitor</dt>
            <dd>The screen that was used as the main output device for the computer.</dd>

            <dt>CPU</dt>
            <dd>
                The control unit, ALU, and registers are collectively known as a central processing unit (CPU).
                Early CPUs were composed of many separate components. Since the 1970s, CPUs have typically been
                constructed on a single MOS integrated circuit chip called a microprocessor.
            </dd>

            <dt>Memory</dt>
            <dd>Short term storage of programs and variables</dd>

            <dt>Hard disk drive</dt>
            <dd>Long term storage of programs and files</dd>

            <dt>Floppy drive</dt>
            <dd>A smaller and portable long term storage medium of programs and files.</dd>

            <dt>Keyboard</dt>
            <dd>The standard input device of computers.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>There are two types of memory:</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>RAM</dt>
            <dd>Random access memory. The memory usable by programs. The amount was typically in the ballpark of
                20 to 64 kilobytes. However, the Basic interpreter by default consumed a part of this.</dd>

            <dt>ROM</dt>
            <dd>Read-only memory. This was normally smaller in size than RAM and roughly corresponded
                to the hardware implementation of the operating system.</dd>
