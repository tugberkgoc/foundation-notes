# Setup

Welcome to the first worksheet. In it you will be setting up your development environment using the Codeanywhere online IDE and running your first (static) website.

## Codeanywhere

The first step is to configure the Codeanywhere IDE. Go the the [Codeanywhere website](https://codeanywhere.com) and log in. You may need to create an account first.

Now you need to create a new **Project** by accessing the _File_ menu as shown.

Finally you will need to add a new **Container**. You should add the _NodeJS_ container running under _Ubuntu_ as shown. Give it the name `labs`.

You now have an Ubuntu development environment running NodeJS.

## 2 Cloning the Lab Materials

Now we have to _clone_ the repository containing the lab materials. Start by opening the [TEACHING_MATERIALS](https://github.coventry.ac.uk/205CDE-1718JANMAY/TEACHING-MATERIALS) repository on GitHub.
