    <p itemprop="description">
        This is a subjective review of said motion picture, please take it with a grain of salt.
    </p>

    <p itemprop="reviewBody">
        From the first sentence, the first word, the first nervily in-drawn breath, this compulsively watchable picture
        announces itself as the unmistakable work of Aaron Sorkin. His whip-smart, mile-a-minute dialogue made The West
        Wing deeply addictive on TV, and after uncertain works such as Charlie Wilson's War and the strange,
        small-screen drama Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip – in which Sorkin's distinctive, faintly martyred seriousness
        was bafflingly applied to the backstage shenanigans of a fictional television comedy – this writer is
        triumphantly back on form. He's found an almost perfect subject: the creation of the networking website
        Facebook, and the backstabbing legal row among the various nerds, geeks, brainiacs and maniacs about
        who gets the credit and the cash.
