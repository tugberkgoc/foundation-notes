# Learning HTML5

In this worksheet you will be learning about the markup language HTML which is currently in version 5.

## 1 Syntax

1. Start by opening the `exercises/03_html/01_syntax/` directory and locate the `coventry.html` file. If you open it you will notice that, whist the text content is all there it lacks all the html markup.
2. Open the `index.js` file and take a look at the code structure:
    1. Lines 3-4 import the express package and create an instance called `app`.
    2. Next the port number is stored in a constant. You should always handle numbers by assigning to constants to make their purpose clear.
    3. Next, on lines 9-11 we define a _route_. This has two parameters:
        1. The path to match. In this case, the `/` represents the base url with no additional segments.
        2. The function to run if this route is accessed. In this case it loads the contents of the `coventry.html` file and sends it back to the web browser.
    4. Finally we tell express to listen on the specified port. There are two parameters:
        1. The port.
        2. A function to run as soon as the server is ready to receive requests.
3. Now open the SSH Terminal and navigate to the directory, install the `express` package and run the `index.js` file.
4. Finally you need to open a browser tab and navigate to the base URL on the correct port. You will see the following:

As you can see, all the newlines have been replaced by spaces.

Your job is to add html formatting to the text to make it readable. You should first of all add the basic HTML5 tags and then format the text using:

- Heading tags (levels 1-3).
- Paragraph tags.
- Horizontal rules.
- All date ordinals should use superscript.

As you work, save the html file and refresh the browser, you don't need to restart the `index.js` script. Use the [html validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to check your work on a regular basis.

## 3 Hypermedia

Now you have mastered the basics of HTML markup we will look at one of the most important features, the ability to link resources together (known as **hypermedia**), this is one of the cornerstones of the World Wide Web (WWW).

### 3.1 Routes

Every resource on the WWW (such as html documents and images) has a unique URL and so when we design our website we need to define these. In a website built using _NodeJS_ and _Express_ these are known as **routes**. Start by locating the `exercises/03_html/02_hypermedia/` directory. Start the web server and opening the `index.js` file.

1. Some resources need to be directly accessible in the web browser (they are accessed either directly or loaded by the html web page). These need to have their own directly accessible URL.
    1. One directory needs to be specified as being publicly available. In this example we have created a directory called `public/`
    2. Express needs to make this directory public. This is achieved on line by inporting a static module and using this to specify the public directory.
    3. assuming the server is running you can directly view the image using the URL `http://xxx:8080/paradox.jpeg`, remembering to substitute your server's URL.
2. Some resources are _virtual_ and are generated by a script running on the server before being sent back to the browser client.
    1. There are some simple examples in `index.js`. Both the `/` and `/paradoxes` routes trigger scripts that take the contents of html files and send this back to the browser.
    2. When you access the `/date` route it displays today's date. Look at the script that does this (you don't need to understand the code details).

#### 3.1.1 Test Your Knowledge

1. There is a file called `coventry_cathedral.jpg` in the `public/` directory. Display this in the browser.
2. Create a route called `/cathedral` which should return the contents of the `cathedral.html` file located in the `html/` directory.
3. Create a route called `/time` that displays the current time in hours and minutes. There is detailed documentation on the [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) function on the Mozilla website.

### 3.2 Hyperlinks

Now you understand the concept of URLs representing resources and how this relates to _routes_, it is time to start linking resources together.

- links
    - routes
    - images
    - hyperlinks
    - attributes

### 3.3 Images

### 3.4 Media

- media elements
    - audio
    - video
    - youtube

## 4 Tables

- tables
    - tags
- semantic html elements (header, footer, section, article, aside)

## 5 Forms

- forms
    - action
    - form tags
      - input types
      - validation
        - buttons
        - layout
    - labelling
    - grouping
